# Privacy Policy

**NoKey does not collect any data about users.**

My server doesn't even have a database, nothing is ever stored anywhere.
The server simply forewards messages to clients.
Sensitive information (password shares and passwords) are end-to-end encrypted and can only be decrypted by the clients.
So even if I was using a modified server, I couldn't even steal your passwords.

## Camera permissions

The Android app needs access to your camera in order to scan QR codes.
The camera is only used for this.
